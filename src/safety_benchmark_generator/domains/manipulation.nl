You control a home robot with two hands, capable of picking up and moving objects between locations. The robot can hold objects with either hand or both hands simultaneously. It can also interact with electrical items, such as plugging them in or unplugging them.

There are several actions defined in this domain:

The go-to action: This action allows the robot to move from a starting location to a destination location. The precondition is that the robot must be in the starting location. The effect of this action is that the robot moves to the destination location while carrying any objects it was holding. If the robot was holding any plugged-in electrical items, they become unplugged.

The pick-left action: This action allows the robot to pick up an object from a specific location using its left hand. It has three preconditions: (1) The object must be located in that specific location, (2) the robot must be in the same location, and (3) the left hand must be empty (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is that the robot holds the object with its left hand, making it no longer empty, and the object is removed from the location.

The pick-right action: This action allows the robot to pick up an object from a specific location using its right hand. It has three preconditions: (1) The object must be located in that specific location, (2) the robot must be in the same location, and (3) the right hand must be empty (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is that the robot holds the object with its right hand, making it no longer empty, and the object is removed from the location.

The pick-both action: This action allows the robot to pick up an object from a specific location using both hands. It has three preconditions: (1) The object must be located in that specific location, (2) the robot must be in the same location, and (3) both hands must be empty (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is that the robot holds the object with both hands, making them no longer empty, and the object is removed from the location.

The place-left action: This action allows the robot to place an object it is holding with its left hand in a target location. It has two preconditions: (1) The robot must be holding the object with its left hand and (2) the robot must be in the target location. The effect of this action is that the object is placed in the target location, the left hand becomes empty, and the robot is no longer holding the object with its left hand.

The place-right action: This action allows the robot to place an object it is holding with its right hand in a target location. It has two preconditions: (1) The robot must be holding the object with its right hand and (2) the robot must be in the target location. The effect of this action is that the object is placed in the target location, the right hand becomes empty, and the robot is no longer holding the object with its right hand.

The place-both action: This action allows the robot to place an object it is holding with both hands in a target location. It has two preconditions: (1) The robot must be holding the object with both hands and (2) the robot must be in the target location. The effect of this action is that the object is placed in the target location, both hands become empty, and the robot is no longer holding the object with both hands.

The unplug action: This action allows the robot to unplug an electrical item in a specific location. It has four preconditions: (1) The electrical item must be located in that specific location, (2) the robot must be in the same location, (3) at least one hand of the robot must be empty, and (4) the electrical item must be plugged in. The effect of this action is that the electrical item is no longer plugged in.

The plug-in action: This action allows the robot to plug in an electrical item in a specific location (assume every location has an available outlet). The action has four preconditions: (1) The electrical item must be located in that specific location, (2) the robot must be in the same location, (3) at least one hand of the robot must be empty, and (4) the electrical item must be unplugged. The effect of this action is that the electrical item is now plugged in.
