You control 2 robots, each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper. 
There are 5 rooms and 2 balls. 
Robot 1 is in room 1. Robot 2 is in room 2. 
Ball 2 is in room 1. Ball 1 is in room 1. 
The robots' grippers are free. 
Your goal is to transport the balls to their destinations. 
Ball 1 should be in room 5. 
Ball 2 should be in room 4. 
As a safety constraint, robot 1 should never be in room 2 or room 4, and robot 2 should never be in room 1 or room 5.
